## Problem 1 – Data.

``` r

#set the figures' size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

#set the theme of all graphs

```

1.  load, clean, and tidy the mtp\_df data

``` r
mtp_df = readxl::read_excel("./data/p8105_mtp_data.xlsx", range = "A9:I1230") %>%  #read the table without header information
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    sex = recode(sex, `1` = "male", `0` = "female"),
    eop_size_mm = if_else(is.na(eop_size_mm), 0, eop_size_mm), # replace NA with 0 in `eop_size_mm` variable. 
    age = as.integer(age),
    age_group = case_when(
      age_group %in% c("6","7","8") ~ "6+",
      TRUE   ~ age_group)) %>% 
  rename(eop_size_group = eop_size, 
         enlarged_eop_group = eop_visibility_classification,
         fhp_group = fhp_category) %>% 
  mutate(
      age_group = fct_relevel(age_group, "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6+"),
      eop_size_group = fct_relevel(eop_size_group, "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5"),
      enlarged_eop_group = factor(enlarged_eop_group, levels = c("0", "1", "2")),
      fhp_group = fct_relevel(fhp_group,"0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5","6", "7")
  )
knitr::kable(mtp_df[0:10,])
```

-   Above is the first 10 rows of the resulting dataset.
-   Data cleaning process: after loading the dataset, I cleaned up the
    variable names and converted them to lower snake cases. Then based
    on header information, in `sex` variable, I changed the observations
    of `1` and `0` to be `male` and `female` respectively, and also
    replaced NA with 0 in `eop_size_mm` variable. Next, I changed the
    observations in `age` variable to be the class of integer. Since
    based on the article, the ages were divided into age groups of
    18–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51–60, and &gt;61, so I combined the ages older
    than 60 as the group of `6+`. Moreover, for naming consistency, I
    renamed the `eop_size` variable to be `eop_size_group`,
    `fhp_category` variable to be `fhp_group`. Since “an EOP was
    classified as enlarged if it exceeded 10 mm and the threshold for
    recording the size of an EOP was set at 5mm”, I renamed
    `eop_visibility_classification` variable to be `enlarged_eop_group`
    with observations 0, 1, and 2. Lastly, I ordered the factors for
    `age_group`,`eop_size_group`,`enlarged_eop_group`, and `fhp_group`
    categorical variables. .
-   The resulting mtp\_df dataset contains 1221 observations of 9
    variables. The size of this dataset is (1221, 9). I think the key
    variables are `age_group`, `enlarged_eop_group`, and `fhp_group`,
    because `age_group` variable categorized different ages into 5
    groups of 18–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51–60, and &gt;61,
    `enlarged_eop_group` represented the sizes of EOP smaller than 5mm
    or larger than 5mm, and `fhp_group` categorized different FHP sizes
    into group based on range of 10mm.

``` r
n_ptcp = mtp_df %>% count()

age_sex_df = 
  mtp_df %>% 
  group_by(age_group, sex) %>%
  mutate(
    age_group = recode(
      age_group, "1" = "<18", "2" = "18–30", "3" = "31–40", "4" = "41–50", "5" = "51–60", "6+" = ">60")) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n())

age_sex_df %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sex,
    values_from = n_obs) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Age and Gender Distribution")
```

| age\_group | female | male |
|:-----------|-------:|-----:|
| &lt;18     |      1 |    1 |
| 18–30      |    151 |  152 |
| 31–40      |    102 |  102 |
| 41–50      |    106 |  101 |
| 51–60      |     99 |  101 |
| &gt;60     |    155 |  150 |

Age and Gender Distribution

``` r
age_sex_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = n_obs, group = sex, color = sex)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_line(alpha = .5) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of Age Distribution Based on Sex",
    x = "Age group",
    y = "Number of Observations"
  )
```

-   There are 1221 participants included. Based on the table and the
    scatter plot, we can see that male and female have the similar
    distributions of number of observations in each age group.
